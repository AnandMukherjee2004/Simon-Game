# 🎮 Simon Game

A fun and interactive memory-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal is simple—repeat the sequence of colors shown by the game. Each round gets tougher as the sequence gets longer!

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Click the **Start** button (or press any key, depending on your setup).
2. Watch the pattern of colors and sounds.
3. Repeat the pattern by clicking the buttons in the correct order.
4. If you succeed, the game adds one more color to the sequence.
5. Make a mistake, and it's **Game Over**!

Can you beat your high score?
